#Milarby Acoustic Duo
This has been developed for my MS1 project - Code Institute. 
It will be website for a friends band to promote their great talents and enhance their future ambitions.

##UX
Currently they only operate via facebook but the addition of this website will expand their customer base.
The objective was to follow the same theme and colours from their facebook page with media links to make them proceed to either the 'Contact Us' button or navbar icon and be presented with the same form Modal.
At 1st I designed the website so the navbar would display different web pages with the same header and footers but after discussion with the band we decided to go for the one flowing index page with the navbar taking you to the different sections. This way if the navbar was not used and the user scrolled down the page they would encompass all sections and then hopefully clicking the contact option.    

I used Adobe XD to design the mockup for full screen and mobile which was also changed slightly while developing the website through reviews with the band. (bit of an Agile approach).

##Technologies and approach adopted.
I used HTML5, CSS3 and then Java for progressive enhancements. With the mobile 1st approach I used Bootstrap to get the grid operating responsively to different devices. When that was achieved i worked on each section trying to use Boostrap styling as much as possible. Thereafter i used Java Jumbotron and modals then started styling with my own CSS enhancements.
Projects like the Whiskey landing page and the CV from the course helped me with ideas.
I revisited the tutorial modules and many times and used Google searches directed me to W3Schools and CSS-tricks for help.      

##Features
At 1first I wanted to use the collapsable navbar for all screens but decided the expanded navbar for full screens had a better feel. 


##Features Left to Implement
Connect the submit function to send an email to the Milarby Acoustic Duo band with an automated reply to the requestor.

##Testing.
Added the required Grid structure, 
Added a color to each section with placeholders and checked it worked for different device sizes.
Checked that the navbar tabs took you to the correct sections.
Tested the 'contact tab and contact us button' to ensure the modal worked for both.
Tried to submit an empty form but email is a required field and displayed a screen message.
Entered an invalid email address and got the validaion message to include a '@'.
Tested that the video and youtube footer icon link redirected you to a new page to play on YouTube.
Tested that the Facebook footer icon link redirected you to the bands facebook page.
Tested the MP3 audio icons played correctly.
Used W3C markup validator to ensure all tags were open ,closed and correct attributes were used.


##Deployment
GitHub was frequently used from the initial commit and after each milestone or test fix to ensure 
no rework was required.
The master branch was used throught this project.

##Content
The content is similiar to the Bands facebook page and they expanded on the paragraph in the About section.

##Media
All the media JPG and MP3 files were provided by the BAND via Dropbox. At 1st I included a MP4 video but we decided it was better in incoprate a link to YouTube as the MP4 file was taking time to load.

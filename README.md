# Milarby Acoustic Duo

Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institue
 
The Music industry is very competitive with my friends only have a Facebook page this was an opportunity
to build a website for them to promote their great talents and enhance their future ambitions.

## Demo

A live demo can be found here 

## UX

The outset was to keep everything simple and get the users to access each section via a full navbar (full screens)
or collapse navbar (for smaller devices) or to cover all the sections by scrolling down the index.html page
without realising it.
That way they would get a feel for the bands atmosphere and be targeted to the 'contact us' areas.

## Technologies.
- Adobe XD,
  - To design the mockup for full screen and mobile which was also changed slightly while 
    developing the website through reviews with the band. (bit of an Agile approach).

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap
- Google Fonts
- Font Awesome

## Features

This comprises of a fullpage cover image of the main page then 4 sections being About, Photos, Video and Audio.
The 'contact us' on the navbar and by means of a button use a Modal with validation.
The Video uses a youtube link and plays on the current index page as this is faster than loading the MP4 footage.
The Facebook and YouTube footer ICONS open new pages via target="_blank" to ensure the Milarby website remains active. 

## Features Left to Implement
Connect the submit function to send an email to the Milarby Acoustic Duo band with an automated reply to the requestor.

## Testing.
- Added the required Grid structure, with colors to each section with placeholders and tested they worked for different device sizes.
- Checked that the navbar tabs redirected you to the correct sections.
- Tested the 'contact tab and contact us button' to ensure the modal worked for both.
- Tried to submit an empty form but all required fields and email formatting was highlighted to proceed before submitting.
- Tested that the video uses a YouTube link with the current index page.
- Tested that the Facebook and YouTube icon links open a new page and keep the current Milarby page actice.
- Tested the MP3 audio icons played correctly.
- Used W3C markup validator to ensure all tags were open ,closed and correct attributes were used.

no rework was required.

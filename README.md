Milarby Acoustic Duo
This has been developed for my MS1 project - Code Institute. 
It will be website for a friends band to promote their great talents and enhance their future ambitions.

UX
Currently they only operate via facebook but the addition of this website will expand their customer base.
The objective was to follow the same theme and colours from their facebook page with media links to make them proceed to either the 'Contact Us' button or navbar icon and be presented with the same form Modal.
At 1st I designed the website so the navbar would display different web pages with the same header and footers but after discussion with the band we decided to go for the one flowing index page with the navbar taking you to the different sections. This way if the navbar was not used and the user scrolled down the page they would encompass all sections and then hopefully clicking the contact option.    

I used Adobe XD to design the mockup for full screen and mobile which was also changed slightly while developing the website through reviews with the band. (bit of an Agile approach).

Technologies and approach adopted.
I used HTML5, CSS3 and then Java for progressive enhancements. With the mobile 1st approach I used Bootstrap to get the grid operating responsively to different devices. When that was achieved i worked on each section trying to use Boostrap styling as much as possible. Thereafter i used Java Jumbotron and modals then started styling with my own CSS enhancements.
Projects like the Whiskey landing page and the CV from the course helped me with ideas. Google searches also directed me to W3Schools for help.      

Features
At 1first I wanted to use the collapsable navbar for all screens but decided the expanded navbar for full screens had a better feel. 


Features Left to Implement
Connect the submit function to send an email to the Milarby Acoustic Duo band with an automated reply to the requestor.

Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

Content
The content is similiar to the Bands facebook page and they expanded on the paragraph in the About section.
Media
All the media JPG and MP3 files were provided by the BAND via Dropbox. At 1st I included a MP4 video but we decided it was better in incoprate a link to YouTube as the MP4 file was taking time to load.
